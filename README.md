Installation and Configuration:

1 - Browser must have Greasemonkey addon (You could use another JS injector app for the .js). Tested with Greasemonkey.

2 - Download either the .JS file or the greasemonkey.zip

3 - Import the .zip or add a new user script and copy and paste the contents of the Lemmytools(.js) file.

4 - Edit the script and to add your home instance of lemmy.

EDIT THIS LINE: const theHomeinstance = ‘https://lemmy.ml’;

This script is all done by a complete amateur for fun. Enjoy and feel free to fork it!
